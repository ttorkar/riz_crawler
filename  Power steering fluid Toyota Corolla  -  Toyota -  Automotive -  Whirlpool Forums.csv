Barry21,,I have a 2005 Corolla with 214 000km ** I was wondering would it be ok to just the drain the power steering resivour and refill. Or if I should consider flushing the system. ** I don’t know when the fluid was last changed since I brought the car used a couple of months ago. ** Also is is ok to mix fluids with different colors? The fluid I’m buying is compatible according to the manual but is a different colour. ** Also if I’m flushing the system. What’s the best way to do it which dosent Involve starting the engine cause I don’t wnna risk getting air to the system. ** Thanks everyone ** 
No.78379,,"Double check the manual, it most likely will be DEXIII – ie Auto Transmission fluid – often used as power steering fluid too. ** I just did drain and refill myself about 3-4 times, I was happy with that. The way I do it is jack up front of car so wheels are 'turnable'. I use a syringe/turkey baster to suck out as much from the reservoir as possible, then turn wheels lock to lock which will pump more fluid back into the reservoir, suck this out. ** Then I refill the reservoir full, and turn wheels lock to lock, even start engine to start power steering pump, turn steering lock to lock a few times. ** It eventually dilutes enough new with old. Yes I could get more out by disconnecting a hose, but I can't be bothered, and this gets it pretty clean. ** Now when I change my auto trans fluid (drain and refill every 30-40k) which changes about 40% of my transmission fluid, I then use any left over in the bottle for power steering change – but don't do the whole hog – just suck out the reservoir amount and refill. This keeps fluid reasonably fresh. ** "
KrisK,,"78379 is spot on,or you can spend about $60 and get a mechanic to flush it and Bob's your uncle ** "
ck_psy,,"I get a turkey baster, remove the old, fill with new and repeat two or three times several days apart. ** This way is much safer than the other 'proper flush' way for the home mechanic. ** I use valvoline max life if your one is compatible. ** "
