2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,"I would like to know how to deal with dealer and Manufacture if the BRAND NEW vehicle is out of technical design specifications. And, the dealer and Manufacture are rejected to provide further repairs to improve the handling control issue. ** I purchased a brand new Toyota RAV4 Hybrid 2WD in July 2019The handling control is not very well due to steering wheel is not able to perform self centering well, and the steering wheel feels so soft when the steering wheel returning from left side.(Note: Only happen on one side only; Steering Wheel returning from the left. Nothing wrong when returning from the right) ** Therefore, I've sent the vehicle back to dealer to carry out a 4-wheel alignment checking.After alignment done by dealer, I found out below critical item are still fails, which does not meet with Toyota's specifications. ** Therefore, I have escalated to Toyota Australia. So surprised me that, both dealer and Toyota Australia have claimed that no fault found, and mentioned not undertaking any further repairs to improve this condition. I did some research on the Internet, which KingPin Angle cannot be changed through out alignment process. ** The alignment Report shown below figures are out of specsCamber LH: -00'43 ; where Manufacture Specifications: -00'07 with tolerance +/- 00'45Camber RH: +00'14; where Manufacture Specifications: -00'07 with tolerance +/- 00'45Camber Maximum Difference: -00'57; where Manufacture Specs: -00'00 with tolerance +/- 00'30 ** King Pin Angle (Before and After alignment these figures are the same, suspected due to manufacturing issue)KingPin Angle LH : +12'48 ; where Manufacture Specs: +11'14 with tolerance +/- 00'30KingPin Angle RH : +11'50; where Manufacture Specs: +11'14 with tolerance +/- 00'30 ** Caster LH: +04'53 ; where manufacture specification +05'42, with tolerance +/- 00'45Caster RH: +04'34; where manufacture specification +05'42, with tolerance +/- 00'45Caster Maximum Difference +00'20: where manufacture specification +00'00, with tolerance +/- 00'30 ** The alignment Report shown figures are within specsTotal Toe: +0.8mm ;   where manufacture specification +0.6mm, with tolerance +/- 1.2mmHalf-Toe LH: +0.4mm ;   where manufacture specification +0.3mm, with tolerance +/- 0.6mmHalf-Toe RH: +0.4mm ;   where manufacture specification +0.3mm, with tolerance +/- 0.6mm ** My friends got a vehicle diagnostic tools to find out there were some history records below.B1249 Double locking ECU communications stopU0155 Lost Communications with strument panel clusterU0163 Lost communications with navigation control moduleU0126 Lost communication with steering angle sensor module ** "

User #217205,,are you an expert in Steering & Suspension? ** I suspect there's nothing wrong with it either. ** 
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,I need the solution how to fix the problem ** 
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,Out of specification....still nothing wrong?are you an expert? ** 
User #217205,Out of specification....still nothing wrong? ** ,"tell me which one/s are out and by how much? ** what do you think it's doing because of it? ** I am more than experienced enough to know , I know you aren't based on your Opening Post. ** "

Fabricati Diem, Pvnc",I need the solution how to fix the problem ** ,Take it to a specialist and get a Hunter laser alignment done. **

Where can I get one of those?",,What is the caster? **

Saadl,What is the caster? ** ,"I guess that's the king pin angle, but it seems a lot to me. I thought it was normally just a few degrees. ** "

User #217205,Alignment Report shown ** ,I've seen and understand the alignment report. Now you tell me what you've taken from it... ** 
"Daft Punk
Please explain!",,OP we do have some professionals here. Can you please explain what is the issue you see in those readings and do you feel any problems while actually driving the car like it's pulling on one side or something? **

b0son,,I'm not going to get into a debate over the numbers … but … ** Does your car steer/handle noticeably worse than the vehicle you test-drove prior to purchase? ** 
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,"These data come from dealer's alignment report, after I've reported the handling issue to them. ** "
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,"Yes, the issue is noticeable every time. And, I have also captured a video to send over to dealer and manufacture. ** "
User #217205,I'm not going to get into a debate over the numbers … but … ** ,"It's so minimal any affects would hardly be felt and I reckon it's a case of comparing to another vehicle and asking the question why does this one feel wrong, when most likely its not. You could back off your driveway and get another set of figures on the alignment bed, the road camber you're driving on etc.. ** "
2019 Toyota RAV4 Owner,,Anyone can let me know how can I share a video here?The issue is noticeable and can feel it every turning. ** 
User #217205,The issue is noticeable and can feel it every turning. ** ,"If it's not the geometry then perhaps it's the component, but Toyota have already given it the once over and concluded that there's nothing wrong and nothing need be done any further. Yes it's hard to trust a Dealership but those figures don't read to be the problem. ** How are the tyre pressures? (I assume Toyota already checked) ** "
